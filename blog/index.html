<p>Given the severity of the disease and abysmal state of healthcare facilities in our country (especially in my state Bihar), <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-beat-covid-19-you-have-to-know-how-a-virus-moves/?fbclid=IwAR1IX3J2iWA_2zNL_ZrRjFg3vtHEBO1JW-UGlKm1_dPHwm8uafcJYdNDCsk">it is very important and imperative to understand the causes of COVID19 infection and ways to avoid it</a>. </p>
<p>Since COVID19 is a novel disease, there is still a lot of research going on. However, <a href="https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/airborne-transmission-coronavirus-covid19-aerosol-indoor-safety/">there is more or less a consensus amongs scientists about the mode of transmission of the virus</a>. It was thought to be spreading through droplets in the beginning, but now a lot of evidences are being put in the public domain; <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422.full">making a strong case for the dominance of aerosol transmission mode</a>. Here in this blog, I'll be discussing about a few papers which have convincingly (in my opinion) demonstrated the dominance of aerosol transmission for the spread of the virus. At the end, I'll discuss the scientific reasoning behind the steps being recommended to keep the coronavirus at bay and the role of ventilation in avoiding the spread of the virus. </p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p><a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0195670120302590?token=73EE9C07DD326FE2DE5CE1B6871673C690D1CA0E8FE0DF4226322A7BE6D8981C794CA5CC351B2395AFEE69739019B906">The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and dry cough</a>. Some patients may exhibit nasal congestion, chills, sore throat or diarrhoea.</p>
<p>[Prominent symptoms]:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fever (74% covid +ve vs 22% covid -ve)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cough</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>In the aforementioned study, Approximately 17% covid +ve did not report fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Among them, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chills">chills</a>, <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/myalgia-overview-4584594">muscle pain or myalgia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis">stuffy nose or coryza</a>, and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/malaise">malaise</a> were the most common symptoms. Symptoms are mild in about 80%, moderate to severe in 15% and critical in 5% of cases. </p>

<h2>Modes of transmission</h2>
<p>Although data on factors related to coronavirus transmission are scarce, the spread of COVID19 is thought to be mostly via the transmission of respiratory droplets and aerosols coming from infected individuals and fomite transmission (transmission via infected surfaces). </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Small droplets, from submicron to approximately 10 μm diameter, produced during speech and coughing, have been shown to contain viral particles, which can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for 3 h. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The droplets can be transmitted either directly by entering the airway through the air (aerosols), or indirectly by contact transfer via contaminated hands (fomite transmission). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fomite transmission may happen via infected surfaces like doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails, phones, switches, pens, keyboards and even via stethoscope if not disinfected before use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mode of transmission could affect whether an infection starts in the upper or lower respiratory tract, which is thought to affect the severity of the disease progression.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0013935120307143-gr2_lrg.jpg"></p>
<p>So, Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily via 3 routes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Large droplets that are expelled with sufficient momentum so as to directly impact the recipients’ mouth, nose or conjunctiva (Droplet transmission).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12682">Physical contact with droplets deposited on a surface and subsequent transfer to the recipient’s respiratory mucosa (Fomite transmission)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inhalation by the recipient of aerosolized droplet nuclei from the expiratory ejecta that are
delivered by ambient air currents (Airborne transmission)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/scientists-say-coronavirus-can-be-spread-farther-than-6-feet-in-tiny-airborne-particles/#x">
<center><img src="../images/covid19/transmission.png" width='650"' height="400"></center></a></p>
<p>Each stage in the transmission process is mediated by complex flow phenomena, ranging from air–mucous interaction, liquid sheet fragmentation, turbulent jets, and droplet evaporation and deposition, to flow-induced particle dispersion and sedimentation. Thus, flow physics is central to the transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, given the importance of flow phenomena to the transmission process, the methods, devices and practices employed to mitigate respiratory infections are also rooted in the principles of fluid dynamics. These include simple methods such as hand washing and wearing face masks, to fogging machines, ventilation and even practices such as social distancing.</p>
<h2>Damages caused by COVID19</h2>
<p>There are evidences emerging which suggest that COVID causes damages to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-doctors-round-up-evidence-of-damage-outside-the-lungs#Direct-damage-to-tissues">multiple organs</a> like kidneys, liver, heart, brain and nervous system, skin and gastrointestinal tract contrary to the popular belief that it causes damages to just lungs ;as was thought in the beginning.</p>

<h2>Ways to avoid the transmission</h2>
<p>For detailed discussion about the measures to mitigate the spread of virus, please have a look at <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/flow-physics-of-covid19/476E32549012B3620D2452F30F2567F1">this paper</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hand Washing:</strong> Due to polar hydrophilic and non-polar hydrophobic sides, soap molecules can easily attach to oils and lipids emulsifying the content in the process which is then washed away with water. Moreover, soap molecules also deactivate the virus by dismantling its lipid envelope. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SfHdSHK-g0">
<center><img src="../images/covid19/handwash.png" width='650"' height="400"></center></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Face masks:</strong> Face masks provide ‘inward’ protection by filtering virus-laden aerosolized particles that would otherwise be inhaled by an uninfected person, and ‘outward’ protection by trapping virus-laden droplets expelled by an infected person. The effectiveness of a simple face mask such as the surgical, N95 or homemade cloth face mask is a function of the combined effect of the filtering properties of the face-mask material, the fit of the mask on the face and the related leaks from the perimeter of the face mask.</p>
<p><em>a. Inward protection</em>: The face-mask material traps droplets and particles via the combined effects of diffusion, inertial impaction, interception and electrostatic attraction. The process of inhalation generates a low pressure in the region interior to the face mask, thereby sealing (or at least reducing) perimeter leaks. Thus, with a reasonably well-fitted face mask, inward protection depends primarily on the face-mask filter material. Studies have shown that, for a given filter, there is an intermediate particle size where filtration efficiency is minimum. Below this size, electrostatic attraction (active for masks such as N95) and diffusion dominate filtration, whereas above this size, impaction and interception are the dominant mechanisms. An increase in fibre density to enhance filtration efficiency is accompanied by an increased pressure drop across the mask (Lai, Poon &amp; Cheung 2012), which requires a greater inhalation effort by the wearer. Thus, an appropriate balance has to be achieved via proper design of the filter material.</p>
<p><em>b. Outward protection</em> : The outward protection afforded by face masks has emerged as a particularly important issue in the COVID-19 pandemic because a SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur early in the course of infection, not only from symptomatic patients but also from asymptomatic as well as minimally symptomatic patients. While a mask can significantly reduce the velocity of the throughflow jet during expiratory events, the increased pressure in the region between the mask and the face pushes the face mask outwards, resulting in increased perimeter leakage. The leakage jets that issue from the perimeter can be turbulent and highly directed. Spasmodic expiratory events such as coughing and sneezing that generate high transient expulsion velocities will significantly diminish the outward protection effectiveness of face masks. </p>
<p>Please have a look at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/57/4/493/158021">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35693-w">this</a> for detailed CFD simulations of flow through N95 masks and factors affecting their efficiencies. </p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Distancing</strong></p>
<p>Since COVID-19 can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes, <strong>1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans</strong>. However, the <em>1.83 m (6 feet) social distancing policy is the “minimum requirement”</em> as this is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. <a href="covid/(https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220300744?via%3Dihub)">Computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model results</a> (employing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) for turbulence simulation) indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. In contrast, low RH (~40%) triggers the evaporation of the water in cough droplets, thereby leading to droplet size reduction, which may lead to a longer time suspended in the air. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can transport from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 seconds. Therefore, <em>a safe social distance is highly dependent on different factors</em>, so i<strong>t is highly recommended that people wear masks and other face coverings when in public</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proper ventilation of indoor environment</strong></p>
<p><a href="covid/(https:/www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(20)30245-9.pdf)">This paper</a> discusses the influence of indoor ventilation on the airborne time of respiratory droplets. They  analysed  the  number  of  droplets (an  average  diameter  of  5  μm  and  are  dispersed   homogeneously   by   the   spray   nozzle) passing  through  the  stationary  laser  sheet  suspended  in  the  centre  of  the  experimental  chamber  using  an  algorithm  that  detects  the  illuminations  caused  by  the  droplets. They  repeated  this  experiment  in  three  rooms  with  different  levels  of  ventilation: no ventilation, mechanical ventilation only, and  mechanical  ventilation  supported  by  the  opening of  an  entrance  door  and  a  small  window. <em>In the best ventilated room, after 30 s the number of  droplets  had  halved,  whereas  with  no  ventilation  this  took  about  5  min. In a poorly ventilated room, the number of droplets was halved in 1·4 min.</em> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/experts-suggest-improving-ventilation-may-reduce-coronavirus-spread/">
<center><img src="../images/covid19/aerosol.png" width='650"' height="400"></center></a></p>
<p>Appropriate building engineering controls in public buildings (such as hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public
transport) include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding; in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene).

<h3>Decontamination of face masks</h3>
<p>Wearing a face mask will not only prevent airborne viral transmission but also reduce the likelihood of one’s hands touching the mouth and nose. It is particularly needed to prevent the transmission from asymptomatic medical professionals to patients and colleagues. Owing to the current shortage of masks, it is prudent to conserve masks whenever possible. </p>

<p>This blog was inspired by <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/">this PeerJ article</a> and relies heavily on the same for content.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog was written in Markdown.</p>
<h3>Why Markdown?</h3>
<p>There are currently 2 options for academics seeking to write technical reports/papers: MIcrosoft Word or LaTeX. From a writer's perspective, the use of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) such as Microsoft Word, WPS Office, or LIbreOffice might be convenient, because the formatting of the document is directy visible. But the complicated syntax specifications often result in problems when using different software versions and for collaborative writing. Simple conversions between file formats can be difficult or impossible. Academic writers might also face the problem of abruptive changes in the document structure; even with an insertion of a single letter. This becomes problematic while working on a large report leading to exasperation and frustation. Not only that, these are very slow and can consume large virtual memory, upto a gig sometimes.</p>
<p>It becomes problematic when you have to convert your files to different file formats for various reason. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For submitting a journal manuscript for peer-review in DOCX, as well as a preprint version with another style in PDF.</li>
<li><strong><em>For submitting your manuscript to journals with considerably different citation styles.</em></strong></li>
<li>For publishing a book with print version in PDF and an electronic versio in EPUB.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, some people work with LaTeX; particularly in the scientific community. With LaTeX, documents with high typographic quality can be produced. However, the source files are cluttered with LaTeX commands and the source text can be complicated to read. Therefore, LaTeX is not user friendly, especially for casual writers or beginners. </p>
<p>Markdown is a plain text markup language which is both lightweight and easy to read and write. It can be easily converted into common formats, such as PDF, HTML, DOCX or EPUB using Pandoc. John Gruber, the original developer of Markdown, defined the goal for Markdown as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure below compares formatting elements and their implementations in different markup languages (<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/">image source</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="Markdown Comparison" src="../images/mdcompare.png" width="96%"></p>
<p>In this blog, I'll explain how to write manuscripts in plain markdown text files recognised by <code>.md</code> file extension which can be easily converted into common formats, such as PDF, HTML, DOCX or EPUB using Pandoc. Apart from that, the use of templates enable the automated generation of documents according to specific journal styles. The simple syntax of markdown facilitates document editing and collaborative writing. Reducing the work spent on manuscript formatting translates directly to time and cost savings for all stakeholders, such as writers, publishers and readers.</p>
<h3>A brief introduction to markdown syntax</h3>
<p>Special symbols are used for formatting texts.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err"># A h1 header</span>

<h4>Markdown Editors</h4>
<p>While any plain text editor can work with markdown, there are some editors dedicated for markdown providing key bindings for common operations like making text bold, italic etc. Some of the open-source editors are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="markdown/remarkableapp.github.io">Remarkable</a></li>

<h3>Writing reports/papers</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/paper-template">Link for markdown paper-template.</a></p>
<p>Markdown relies on <a href="https://pandoc.org"><em>pandoc</em></a> for all conversion tasks. Please follow the steps mentioned in the above link for installation of all dependencies. Installation steps may differ depending on the operating system. Instruction mentioned in the link are pretty generic and can be easily followed on any operating system.</p>
<p><img alt="Markdown Comparison" src="../images/mdflow.png" width="75%"></p>
<p>The above figure shows the workfow for the generation of multiple document formats with Pandoc (<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/">image source</a>). The markdown (MD) file contains the manuscript text with formatting tags, and include references to external files such as images or reference databases. The Pandoc processor converts the MD file to the desired output formats. Documents, citations etc. can be defined in style files or templates. </p>
<p>Now, I'll describe the procedure for typesetting scientific manuscripts with Pandoc, a swiss army knife for document conversion, using examples for typical document elements, such as tables, figures, formulas, code blocks and references. For more detailed discussion, please refer to the <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">pandoc manual</a>.</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables">several options</a> to write tables in markdown; with pipe tables being the most flexible.  The contents of different cells are separated by pipe symbols. </p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">|</span> <span class="nv">Syntax</span>      <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nv">Description</span> <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nv">Text</span>     <span class="p">|</span>

<p>On one hand, syntax for writing tables is very simple but it may very time consuming while generating bigger tables. To simplify the process of table generation, I have written a <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar"><strong><em>python script</em></strong></a> to generate a markdown table using python. The linked github repository contains an <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar/blob/master/table.ipynb"><strong><em>example notebook</em></strong></a> demonstrating the table generation and the same has also been shown below.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">pd</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandoc</span>

<span class="n">df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_csv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'tables/surf.stn.md'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sep</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'\s+'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">tab</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_markdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'table.md'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The above python script saves the generated markdown table in a file named <code>table.md</code> which contains:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">|Stations|Latitude|Longitude|Altitude| Period  |</span>
<span class="err">|--------|-------:|--------:|-------:|---------|</span>
<span class="err">|marb    |  -64.24|   -56.62|     198|2011-2015|</span>
<span class="err">|mcmu    |  -77.82|   166.58|      11|1986-1992|</span>
<span class="err">|arht    |  -77.80|   166.67|     184|1996-2015|</span>
<span class="err">|neum    |  -70.65|    -8.25|      42|1982-2014|</span>
<span class="err">|spol    |  -89.98|   -24.80|    2810|1975-2015|</span>
<span class="err">|syow    |  -69.00|    39.58|      16|1997-2015|</span>
</code></pre>

<h4>Images</h4>
<p>An image can be inserted in markdown using:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Caption</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">images</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ex</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="n">#figure1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">width</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">55</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="err">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre>

<p>Here, figure1 is an identifier for the figure defined with # along with image dimension in braces. </p>
<p>The above text would be rendered as</p>
<p><img alt="Caption" id="figure1" src="../images/pk.jpg" width="55%"></p>
<h4>Equations</h4>
<p>Equations are written in LaTeX mode using the delimiters $.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">specify</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">inline</span> <span class="n">quation</span> <span class="k">like</span> <span class="n">LaTeX</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="err">$</span>

</code></pre>

<h4>Code blocks</h4>
<p>To write code, you indent it by 4 spaces or a tab. Markdown will guess what language you are writing</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">    def main():</span>
<span class="err">        print "Say Hello!!"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>would be rendered as</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
      <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Say Hello!!"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You can specifiy which programming language you are using with delimited blocks if you wish</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```python
def say_hello():
    print('Hi Everybody')
```</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it would be rendered as</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hi Everybody'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<h4>Citations/References</h4>
<p>The efficient organization and typesetting of citations and bibliographies is crucial for academic writing. Pandoc supports various strategies for managing references. For processing the citations and the creation of the bibliography, the command line parameter <code>--filter pandoc-citeproc</code> is used, with variables for the reference database and the bibliography style. A separate <code>.bib</code> file must contain the database of all references with corresponding keys. The used database can be defined either in the YAML metablock of the markdown file or it can be passed as parameter when calling pandoc. Softwares like <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/"><strong><em>Mendeley</em></strong></a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/"><strong><em>Zotero</em></strong></a> can help in creating and maintaining reference databases. </p>
<p>A citation is inserted by using the citation key given within square brackets preceded by '@' as follows:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">[@Solomon2016; @kuttippurath2018] </span>
</code></pre>

<p>The generated references will be inserted automatically below the header <code># References</code> or <code># Bibliography</code>.</p>
<h5>Citation style</h5>
<p>The Citation Style Language (CSL) is used for the citations and bibliographies. This file format is supported by all reference management softwares like Mendeley, Zotero etc. CSL files for a number of journals can be found at <a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles">this link</a>. The bibliography style that pandoc should use for the target document can be specified in the YAML block of the Markdown document or can be passed in as a command line option. Journal reference styles can be easily changed by just changing CSL file to be used; saving lots of sweat while doing the adjustment as in MS Word.</p>
<h4>Meta information</h4>
<p>Document information such as title, authors, their affiliation, correspondence details, abstract, keywords etc. can be defined in a metadata block written in YAML syntax. Variables defined in the YAML section are processed by pandoc and integrated into the generated documents. The YAML metadata block is recognized by three hyphens (---) at the beginning, and three hyphens at the end. for example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="err">---</span>
<span class="c">title: Climate change causes increased heat waves</span>
<span class="c">subtitle: heat waves</span>
<span class="c">date: 2020-05-22</span>
<span class="err">---</span>
</code></pre>

<h4>Pandoc filters</h4>
<p>Pandoc supports lua and python based filters to aid in formatting of the documents. For example: pandoc-citeproc parses the citations included in markdown files, pandoc-crossref allows numbering and cross-referencing of figures, tables and equations across the document. Filters should be specified on the commandline with <code>--filter filterpath</code> or <code>-F filterpath</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>pandoc -F pandoc-citeproc -F pandoc-crossref -o example.docx example.md
</code></pre>

<p>I have written one python filter for <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar/blob/master/pandoc-include.py">inserting any external text</a> in markdown. This filter inserts the text inside the file specified using <code>!include filename.md</code>. This filter should be run separately as a python script as follows:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>python python-include.py --infile infile.md --outfile outfile.md
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://pandoc.org/filters.html">this link</a> for more information regarding pandoc filters and <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-Filters">this link</a> for a list of available third party filters.</p>
<h4>Automatising document generation</h4>
<p>While generation of documents can be automatised using shell scripts, but I prefer to use Makefile for the same. Makefiles are similar to shell scripts with an important difference. While shell script executes the commands specified in it irrespective of the status of files, Makefile considers the status of target files specified when executing a command.</p>
<p>For example: Makefile provided in <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/paper-template">paper template repository</a> consists following:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nv">fig</span> <span class="o">=</span> ./figures/

<p>Above Makefile can be modified appropriately to specify proper paths for images, tables, csl file, bibliography file (.bib), pandoc filters and templates to be used for document generation. Variable <code>upp</code> points to the header markdown file with appropriate YAML blocks to be included in generated documents. Variable <code>main</code> points to markdown file being edited (main.md in this case). </p>

<p>Above lines specify the appropriate arguments to be used for pandoc commandline. Instruction to execute Makefile has been provided in the <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/paper-template">accompanying paper-template repository</a>. For example: <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/paper-template/blob/master/main.pdf">pdf output</a> can be generated using <code>make pdf</code> command. Similarly <a href="https://github.com/pankajkarman/paper-template/blob/master/main.docx">docx</a> can be generated using <code>make docx</code> command. Running command <code>make all</code> or <code>make</code> will generate both pdf and docx outputs. For generating pdf output, LaTeX should be installed on the system before executing the Makefile. Generated docx file might require a little bit of tweaking before shared/submitted.</p>
<h4>Version control</h4>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is one of the most employed software solutions for versioning. Git allows the parallel work of collaborators, and has an efficient merging and conflict resolution system. A Git repository may be used by a single local author to keep track of changes, or by a team with a remote repository; for example, on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>. Because of the plain text format of markdown, Git can be used for version control and distributed writing. Follow <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-primer-to-version-control-using-git-3fbdbb123262">this link</a> for learning how to use git.</p>

    <p class="card-text"style='font-size: large' align='left'> Hi, My name is Pankaj. I am a passionate atmospheric scientist and a machine learning enthusiast. I have recently submitted my PhD thesis titled "Investigation of atmospheric ozone evolution in Antarctica using Machine learning". During my PhD, I studied the interactions between chemistry and weather/climate using a suite of statistical, machine learning and chemical transport models as a member of <a href="https://www.atmoslabiitkgp.com/" style="text-decoration: underline">ATMOS lab</a> at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: underline">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=SWmUS" style="text-decoration: underline">Dr. Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath</a>. I have also developed open source tools for modeling and analysis. My research interests include machine learning, causal network analysis and atmospheric modeling. </p>

<p class="card-text"style='font-size: large' align='left'>
I completed my Master of Technology (MTech) degree in Earth System Science and Technology from IIT Kharagpur where I worked on the problem of stratospheric ozone hole in Antarctica. I have a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) Mesra</a>. </p>
